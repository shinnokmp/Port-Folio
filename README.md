## Getting Started

To start with, this is my Port Folio page, showcasing my different repositories which have been created so far. The page is always going to be under development as SHINNOK ICT SOLUTIONS will continuously engage in different projects (both privately and commercial). All links to projects carried out on the repository will be posted on this page.

This page is written with just HTML and CSS, hopefully JS will be added soon to make it more lively and appealing.
